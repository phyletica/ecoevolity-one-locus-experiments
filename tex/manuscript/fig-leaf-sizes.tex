    Comparing the ability of \ecoevolity (top row) and \dppmsbayes (bottom row)
    to estimate the effective sizes of the descendant populations (scaled by
    the mutation rate) given a locus of length 500, 1000, 2000, and 10,000
    sites.
    Each plotted circle and associated error bars represent the posterior mean
    and 95\% credible interval for the time that a pair of populations
    diverged.
    Each plot consists of 5000 estimates---500 simulated \datasets, each with
    five pairs of populations.

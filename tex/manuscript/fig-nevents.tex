    Comparing the ability of \ecoevolity (top row) and \dppmsbayes (bottom row)
    to estimate the number of divergence events given a locus of length 500,
    1000, 2000, and 10,000 sites.
    Each plot shows the results of the analyses of 500 simulated \datasets,
    each with five population pairs;
    the number of \datasets that fall within each possible cell
    of true versus estimated numbers of events is shown, and cells with
    more \datasets are shaded darker.
